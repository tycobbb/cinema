it gets lonely out here...

i'm not sure where everyone went
hello..........
this used to be someplace nice. my friends and i would play over in those those buildings. on the pile of stuff. it was nice when it was like that.

hello.

as a place, it had a substantial amount. the quantity made it suitable and gave it scale. the discrepancy in scale was desire and, requiring a certain amount of energy.
we saw…

the noise of the nearby highway was there and it was,
trod

it was well-trod but not a significant span. observations of its edges and corners and interiors and of its duration and of its scent and of it
to conceive of a duration,
it requires a sense of scale that i do not have.
is not scale.

i have wondered where it all went
spoken about often and amongst them any chance at perception the contour evokes something and isn’t that nice. spaced in regular intervals with an arm hanging casually and the delighted squeak and a peculiar focus on baldness
i like to think about that yeah

chasing that transformation. a chance to see it a bit differently
but in my
way hahahahaha

ascending periodically and continually axially and
it’s quite dirty
another to ingest
one by two by two by one by two branching on two and five
